 Report on Quiz Site Mockup Design Decisions**

This report outlines the design decisions made for the mockup of the web application for the quiz site project. The primary focus was on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that enhances the overall user experience. The mockup was created using Adobe Illustrator, and it showcases different elements and user actions for both desktop and mobile screen sizes.

Color Scheme:

The chosen color scheme aims to create a visually engaging and accessible interface. The main color palette includes "5bd3bc" for the primary color, representing correctness and success, and "ffbdd2" for incorrect responses, symbolizing alert or error. A clean and neutral white background (#ffffff) enhances readability, while black text ensures clarity and contrast.

- Primary Color :#5bd3bc
- Secondary Color : #ffbdd2
- Background Color: #ffffff
- Text Color: #000000

 Branding:

The selected color palette reflects a harmonious combination that aligns with the theme of a quiz site. The use of vibrant green and soft pink creates a balanced and visually appealing brand identity. The combination of these colors also ensures clear visual feedback to the users based on their responses.

Logo:
I use my name as the logo.

Typography:

The chosen font for the web application is selected with readability and modern aesthetics in mind. A sans-serif font, such as Arial or Open Sans, is recommended for its clean and legible appearance. The font size and weight are adjusted to ensure readability across different screen sizes.

 Layouts for Multiple Screen Sizes:

 Desktop:

The desktop layout is designed to make efficient use of the available screen space. The quiz questions and multiple-choice options are presented in a clear and organized manner. A prominent difficulty level selection is displayed at the start, guiding users through the quiz experience.

Mobile:

For mobile screens, a responsive design is implemented to ensure a seamless user experience on smaller devices. The layout is optimized to stack elements in a logical order, making it easy for users to navigate through the quiz on their mobile devices. Large touch-friendly buttons aid in effortless interaction.

User Interaction:

User actions are intuitive and straightforward. The difficulty level selection is presented prominently on the first page, allowing users to choose between "easy" and "hard" options. After selecting a difficulty level, the user is presented with a quiz question and four multiple-choice options. Immediate visual feedback is provided in the form of green for correct and red for incorrect answers.

Conclusion:

The design decisions made for the quiz site mockup prioritize a clean, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface. The color scheme, typography, and layout choices are aimed at enhancing the overall user experience, ensuring that users can seamlessly navigate the quiz on both desktop and mobile devices.

This design approach aligns with the project goals of creating an engaging and accessible platform for users to test their knowledge.

# Capstone Project - Part 3 Prototype Report

## Overview
For Part 3 of the Capstone Project, a prototype of the web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. The prototype closely aligns with the mockup completed in Part 2 and is designed to be responsive across various devices.

## Steps Taken
1. Creating Branch Structure:A new branch, `part-3`, was created from the `part-2` branch to maintain version control and isolate changes specific to Part 3 development.

2. Setting Up HTML and CSS Files: The prototype includes one HTML file (`index.html`) and one CSS file (`style.css`). The HTML file defines the structure of the web application, while the CSS file handles the styling to closely match the mockup.

3. Leveraging Bootstrap for Responsive Design: Bootstrap, a modern CSS framework, was utilized to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes facilitated the layout design and ensured consistency in styling.

4. Matching Mockup Design:The prototype closely adheres to the design elements specified in the mockup completed in Part 2. This includes typography, colors, layout structure, and interactive elements.

5. Optional JavaScript Integration:While not mandatory, an optional JavaScript file (`script.js`) may be added to the project to enhance interactivity or functionality as needed. This includes features such as form validation, dynamic content loading, or user interface enhancements.

## Resources Used
- Bootstrap: The Bootstrap CSS framework was leveraged for its grid system, responsive utilities, and pre-designed components, streamlining the development process and ensuring a consistent design across different devices.
- Mockup from Part 2: The mockup completed in Part 2 served as a reference point for designing the prototype, ensuring consistency in visual elements and layout.


## Challenges Faced
1. Responsive Design Challenges:Ensuring responsiveness across various devices posed challenges, particularly in adjusting layout and styling for smaller screens while maintaining readability and usability.

2. Integration of External Libraries:While Bootstrap was used for styling, integrating additional JavaScript libraries for enhanced functionality required careful consideration of compatibility and performance implications.

3. Maintaining Consistency with Mockup:Ensuring the prototype closely matched the design elements specified in the mockup required attention to detail and frequent reference to the mockup for comparison.
