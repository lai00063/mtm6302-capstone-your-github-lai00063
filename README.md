 Report on Quiz Site Mockup Design Decisions**

This report outlines the design decisions made for the mockup of the web application for the quiz site project. The primary focus was on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that enhances the overall user experience. The mockup was created using Adobe Illustrator, and it showcases different elements and user actions for both desktop and mobile screen sizes.

Color Scheme:

The chosen color scheme aims to create a visually engaging and accessible interface. The main color palette includes "5bd3bc" for the primary color, representing correctness and success, and "ffbdd2" for incorrect responses, symbolizing alert or error. A clean and neutral white background (#ffffff) enhances readability, while black text ensures clarity and contrast.

- Primary Color :#5bd3bc
- Secondary Color : #ffbdd2
- Background Color: #ffffff
- Text Color: #000000

 Branding:

The selected color palette reflects a harmonious combination that aligns with the theme of a quiz site. The use of vibrant green and soft pink creates a balanced and visually appealing brand identity. The combination of these colors also ensures clear visual feedback to the users based on their responses.

Logo:
I use my name as the logo.

Typography:

The chosen font for the web application is selected with readability and modern aesthetics in mind. A sans-serif font, such as Arial or Open Sans, is recommended for its clean and legible appearance. The font size and weight are adjusted to ensure readability across different screen sizes.

 Layouts for Multiple Screen Sizes:

 Desktop:

The desktop layout is designed to make efficient use of the available screen space. The quiz questions and multiple-choice options are presented in a clear and organized manner. A prominent difficulty level selection is displayed at the start, guiding users through the quiz experience.

Mobile:

For mobile screens, a responsive design is implemented to ensure a seamless user experience on smaller devices. The layout is optimized to stack elements in a logical order, making it easy for users to navigate through the quiz on their mobile devices. Large touch-friendly buttons aid in effortless interaction.

User Interaction:

User actions are intuitive and straightforward. The difficulty level selection is presented prominently on the first page, allowing users to choose between "easy" and "hard" options. After selecting a difficulty level, the user is presented with a quiz question and four multiple-choice options. Immediate visual feedback is provided in the form of green for correct and red for incorrect answers.

Conclusion:

The design decisions made for the quiz site mockup prioritize a clean, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface. The color scheme, typography, and layout choices are aimed at enhancing the overall user experience, ensuring that users can seamlessly navigate the quiz on both desktop and mobile devices.

This design approach aligns with the project goals of creating an engaging and accessible platform for users to test their knowledge.
